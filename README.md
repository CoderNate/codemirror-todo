# CodeMirror Todo

A basic to-do list based on CodeMirror's support for markdown and vim.
It's probably not very useful for anyone else but I wanted something
simple like [todo.txt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) but I don't
care about due dates and tags so markdown seemed ideal. I frequently
link to issues in my to-do list so CodeMirror's "conceal" feature
is nice for hiding long links until you put your cursor on it.
